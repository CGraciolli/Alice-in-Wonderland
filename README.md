# Alice in Wonderland
A simple textual analysis of the text from "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll.

The objetive is to analyse how many times non-stop words are present in the text of "Alice in Wonderland".

In order to do so, first we tokenize the text using NLTK.

Then we get remove all the stop-words, as well as punctuation and suffixes.

Now that the data is normalized, we create a frequency dictionary, telling us how many times each word is present in the text.

Then we create a dictionary of probabilities, telling us what is the probability of a word being picked at random from all the non-stop words from the text.

Finally, we create a histogram from this dictionary of probabilities (for better visualization, we round the probabilities and donÂ´t show the ones that are rounded to zero).
